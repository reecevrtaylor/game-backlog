# Game Backlog App

## Description

This Game Backlog App is a personal, project-based learning web application developed to manage and track video game collections and playthroughs. While it places a strong emphasis on seamless integration with the Steam platform, enabling users to efficiently manage and track their Steam game collections, it also offers the flexibility to manually add and manage games from other platforms. This includes consoles like the PS5 and other PC gaming platforms.
